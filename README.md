# Chronic Kidney Disease Models
This repository contains implementations of four different models to predict chronic kidney disease in patients based on blood tests.

The models included in this project are:

### Models
1. Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between features. It is well-suited for handling high-dimensional data and is computationally efficient.

2. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K Nearest Neighbors is a simple and intuitive classification algorithm that assigns a class label to an instance based on the majority class of its K nearest neighbors in the feature space.

3. K Means Clustering
K Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data into K distinct clusters. It aims to partition data points into clusters such that points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

4. Connected Neural Network
The Connected Neural Network, also known as a fully connected neural network or multi-layer perceptron (MLP), is a powerful deep learning model capable of learning complex patterns and representations from data.
